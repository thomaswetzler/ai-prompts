## Retrospective Facilitation Guide

### Preparation

1. **Gather Data**:
   - Sprint metrics
   - Task completion status
   - Test results
   - Deployment logs
   - Memory bank update status

2. **Prepare Environment**:
   - Schedule meeting with all team members
   - Set up collaborative document for notes
   - Prepare visualizations of sprint metrics

### Meeting Structure (60-90 minutes)

1. **Welcome & Set the Stage (5 min)**:

   - Review key metrics
   - Acknowledge team achievements

3. **What Went Well (15 min)**:
   - Round-robin sharing of positives
   - Document all responses
   - Look for patterns and themes

4. **What Could Be Improved (15 min)**:
   - Round-robin sharing of challenges
   - Document all responses
   - Group similar items

5. **Technical & Process Discussion (20 min)**:
   - Deeper dive into technical discoveries
   - Discuss process optimization opportunities
   - Identify knowledge gaps and learning needs

6. **Action Items (15 min)**:
   - Create specific, actionable items from discussion

### Post-Retrospective

1. **Document Everything**:
   - Complete the retrospective template
   - Update Memory Bank files
   - Share notes with the team

2. **Follow Up on Action Items**:
   - Create tickets/tasks for action items
