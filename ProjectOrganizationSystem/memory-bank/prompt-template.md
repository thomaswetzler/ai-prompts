# AI News Kubernetes Project - Task Request Template

## Task Information

Task ID: S2T3
Task Type: Feature Implementation
Priority: High
Description: Implement resource limits for the AI News application pods in Kubernetes

## Current Context

Current Branch: resource-limits
Related Files: 
- kubernetes/deployment.yaml
- charts/ai-news/templates/deployment.yaml
- charts/ai-news/values.yaml
Dependencies: None

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CPU requests set to 250m
- [ ] CPU limits set to 500m
- [ ] Memory requests set to 384Mi
- [ ] Memory limits set to 1Gi
- [ ] Limits configured in both raw Kubernetes manifest and Helm chart
- [ ] Values parameterized in Helm chart's values.yaml

## Testing Requirements

Test Cases:
- Verify pod creation succeeds with resource limits
- Verify resource limits are correctly applied with kubectl describe
- Test that application functions correctly within these limits
- Test that values.yaml overrides work correctly

## Additional Information

Based on our performance testing, the application typically uses around 200-300MB of memory and 0.2-0.4 CPU cores under normal load.

## Memory Bank Context

According to techContext.md, our resource constraints specify that the application should run within 0.5 CPU cores and 1GB memory.
